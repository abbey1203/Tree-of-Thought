        "# 5 METRICS: BARTScore, BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and FactCC\n",
        "BARTScore, BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and FactCC are metrics commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) to evaluate the quality of machine-generated text, particularly in tasks like text summarization, machine translation, and text generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **BARTScore**:\n",
        "   - BARTScore is a metric that uses the BART model, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models, to score the similarity between generated and reference texts.\n",
        "   - It computes the likelihood of the generated text being produced from the reference text, treating it as a noising process, and uses this as a score to measure the quality of the generated text.\n",
        "   - To use BARTScore, you need a machine learning environment (like Python) with the necessary libraries (like Hugging Face's Transformers) installed. You would use the BART model within this environment to compute BARTScores for your generated text compared to your reference text.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**:\n",
        "   - BLEU is a metric for evaluating the quality of text which has been machine-translated from one natural language to another. It measures how many words, phrases, and sentences overlap (match exactly) between the generated text and a set of reference texts.\n",
        "   - BLEU can be computed using natural language processing libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) in Python. It involves tokenizing the texts into words (or sometimes subwords or characters), then counting the matching tokens, and normalizing by the lengths of the texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering)**:\n",
        "   - METEOR is similar to BLEU but considers not only the exact word matches but also the synonyms and the stemming forms of the words. It also explicitly rewards reordering of phrases and penalizes word mismatches.\n",
        "   - Like BLEU, METEOR is often used in machine translation and can be calculated using libraries like NLTK in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**:\n",
        "   - ROUGE is used primarily in evaluating text summarization systems. It compares the overlap between the n-grams, word sequences of length n, in the generated text and reference text(s). ROUGE-L, specifically, considers the longest common subsequence (LCS) of words in its calculation.\n",
        "   - There are several variants (like ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, etc.), each considering different types of overlap. These can be computed using Python libraries like `rouge-score` or `pyrouge`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **FactCC**:\n",
        "   - FactCC is a metric designed to evaluate factual consistency in text summarization. It uses a pre-trained BERT model to predict if the generated summary contradicts, entails, or is neutral to the source document.\n",
        "   - Implementing FactCC requires a machine learning environment with a library that includes BERT (like Hugging Face's Transformers).\n",
        "   - FactCC evaluates whether a source document as a whole implies a generated sentence."

            "you can always catch an illness from a child but most of these are viral like colds your pneumonia shot only protects you from certain types of bacterial pneumonia pneumococcus it would not protect you at all from viruses any respiratory virus can cause pneumonia or sinusitis if you are prone to these types of infections\n",

            "\n",
            "1. Evaluate your grandchild's health status: Assess whether your grandchild currently has a sinus infection or walking pneumonia. If she is showing symptoms or has been diagnosed, the risk of transmission may be higher. However, it is still crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to understand the specific pathogens involved and their transmission dynamics.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Consider the symptoms and duration of illnesses: Sinus infections and walking pneumonia have distinct symptoms and durations. Sinus infections typically present with facial pain, congestion, and nasal discharge, while walking pneumonia may cause persistent cough, fatigue, and chest discomfort. Understanding these differences can help identify potential signs of infection.\n",

However, it is still important to practice preventive measures and consult with a healthcare professional for guidance.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Evaluate your own immune system: The effectiveness of the pneumonia shot and your overall immune system play a role in determining the risk of contracting infections. If your immune system is compromised or if the pneumonia shot does not provide full protection, the risk may be higher. Discuss your specific situation with a healthcare professional to assess your individual risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Consider the vulnerability of others in your age group: Older adults may be more susceptible to respiratory infections, including sinus infections and walking pneumonia. If you are a carrier of these infections, it is important to take precautions to minimize the risk of transmission to others in your age group. This may include wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and avoiding close contact with vulnerable individuals.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Stay vigilant and monitor for symptoms: Even if the risk of transmission is low, it is important to stay vigilant and monitor for any symptoms of infection. If you develop symptoms such as a persistent cough, fever, or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention promptly.\n",
            "\n",

This information can help alleviate any concerns or doubts the RN may have.\\n\\nIf the RN remains hesitant, it may be worthwhile to suggest consulting with a trusted healthcare professional, such as a pediatrician or infectious disease specialist, who can address any specific concerns or provide personalized recommendations based on the family's medical history.\\n\\nOverall, the key is to approach the situation with empathy, understanding, and open-mindedness, while providing accurate information and involving relevant parties in the discussion to find a solution that prioritizes the health and well-being of all involved.\"], 0.7)]\n"
